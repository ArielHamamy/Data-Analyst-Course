#**Final project from my Data Analyst Course â€“ Tourism Analytics Case Study -Thailand**

This project presents a **data-driven A/B test** analyzing tourism performance in Krabi vs. Koh Samui during 2025.
Using real-world indicators such as **tourist arrivals, revenue trends, and cost-to-revenue ratios**, the study evaluates the impact of hotel discounts and free shuttles on tourist confidence and profitability.
Results show a **+15% rise in the Tourism Confidence Index, 18% higher arrivals**, and **$46M in additional revenue**, achieved with a **total test cost of $2.2M (~5%)**.
